                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a 4th-year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at The University of Texas at Austin, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With a strong foundation in C, C++, and ARM Assembly programming, along with hands-on experience in hardware and software development, I have contributed to cutting-edge projects during internships at Valero, Tesla, and Real-Time Power. My journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set, ranging from PLC programming and HMI design to 3D modeling and circuit design, enabling me to tackle challenges across various engineering domains. I take pride in translating technical expertise into practical solutions, such as enhancing process control systems and developing user-friendly interfaces for advanced manufacturing processes.

                    Committed to continuous learning, I thrive in collaborative environments, approaching challenges with a solutions-oriented mindset and a willingness to take on leadership roles. I have been recognized with the Engineering Honors full-ride scholarship and the UT for Me/Dell Scholars foundation scholarship, demonstrating my academic dedication and excellence. Bilingual in Spanish and English, I effectively communicate complex ideas and contribute to diverse, multidisciplinary teams. Driven by a desire for innovation and a commitment to excellence, I seek opportunities to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, aiming to develop transformative projects in the fields of automation, embedded systems, and renewable energy technologies.</p>
